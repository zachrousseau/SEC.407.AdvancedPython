# Program #02:

# Write a Python program to find the students with the maximum and minimum ages in a
# dictionary.

# Console
# Original dictionary elements:
# {'Chris': 18, 'Nicole': 32, 'Doug': 22, 'Betty': 45, 'David':
# 33, 'Lilah': 20}
# Maximum Age is for Betty which is 45
# Minimum Age is for Chris which is 18
# Specifications
# â€¢ Use max() and min() with key=<dict_name>.get
