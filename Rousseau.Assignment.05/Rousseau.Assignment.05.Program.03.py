# Program #03:

# Write a Python program to find numbers divisible by fifteen or thirteen from a list of numbers using
# Lambda and filter function.
# Console
# Orginal list:
# [19, 65, 57, 39, 45, 152, 639, 121, 44, 90, 190, 200, 26, 130]
# Numbers of the above list divisible by nineteen or thirteen:
# [65, 39, 45, 90, 26, 130]
# Specifications
# â€¢ User filter function.
